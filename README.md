# Vision-Based-Automatic-Door-Entry-System
It is a Computer Vision based Automatic Door Entry System where only humans wearing masks will be allowed entry

# Human Detection
Human or Person detection is performed using ***YOLO(You Only Look Once)*** algorithm

# Face Detection
Face detection is done using Haar like features of ***Viola Jones*** algorithm which uses a Cascading Classifier

# Mask Detection
Mask Detection is done using CNN model with 2 convolution layers and 2 fully connected layers and accuracy is 95%
